    "selftext": "From Promise to Pain: Arsenal\u2019s Most Heartbreaking Injury Stories\n\nWhile we often celebrate the brilliance of players who go on to lift trophies and carve their names into club history, football is also filled with stories of careers cut short or altered beyond repair due to injuries. Here\u2019s a look at five former Arsenal stars whose journeys were shaped \u2013 and sometimes halted \u2013 by unfortunate injuries.\n\n# 1. Malcolm Macdonald\n\nA prolific striker in the 1970s, Macdonald joined Arsenal from Newcastle with great expectations and made an instant impact, netting 29 goals in his debut season. In total, he scored 57 goals in just over 100 appearances.\n\nA lightning-fast forward with strength, power and an eye for goal, his promising run came to a tragic end due to a severe ankle injury suffered during a cup tie. Forced into early retirement at 29, his career is still remembered for what could have been.\n\n# 2. Abou Diaby\n\nTouted as a future replacement for Patrick Vieira, Diaby had the elegance, athleticism, and technical brilliance to dominate the midfield. However, a horrific ankle injury early in his Arsenal career changed everything.\n\nDespite numerous comeback attempts, he was constantly plagued by injuries and could only manage 182 appearances over nearly a decade. It's estimated he lost over five years of playing time.\n\n# 3. Santi Cazorla\n\nFew players lit up the Emirates like Cazorla. Known for his ambidexterity, intelligence and joy on the ball, he became a fan favourite. His memorable free-kick in the FA Cup final against Hull is etched in club folklore.\n\nUnfortunately, what started as a minor knock during a friendly escalated into a catastrophic injury, resulting in eight surgeries and a near loss of his foot. He missed the final 18 months of his Arsenal contract and was never truly replaced.\n\n# 4. Aaron Ramsey\n\nA player who consistently gave everything for the badge, Ramsey played over 350 times for Arsenal and scored some of the club\u2019s most important modern goals, including two FA Cup winners at Wembley.\n\nHis progress was interrupted by a career-threatening leg break against Stoke City \u2013 the result of a reckless challenge. Though he returned and continued to perform at a high level, many believe that incident prevented him from reaching an even higher peak.\n\n# 5. Eduardo da Silva\n\nOne of the most natural finishers seen at Arsenal since Ian Wright, Eduardo had all the tools to become a world-class striker. In his debut season, he looked destined to take Arsenal\u2019s attack to the next level.\n\nThen came that infamous match at Birmingham. A reckless tackle shattered his leg and dislocated his ankle, sidelining him for over a year. He never fully recovered his explosive sharpness and left the club not long after.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nFootball can be cruel, and these five players are reminders that talent alone is never enough. Injuries \u2013 especially serious ones \u2013 can take away not just a player\u2019s form, but years of their career.\n\nDo you think anyone else should be on this list? Which of these players do you feel was the biggest loss? Share your views in the comments below \u2014 and make sure to follow this page for more Arsenal insights, updates, and reflections.",

    "selftext": "I\u2019ve always loved the idea of the Club World Cup. To me, it should be the pinnacle of club football, the one competition that brings together the best teams from every continent. As a mad football fan, I\u2019ve always felt this tournament should\u2019ve been a major event from the very beginning.\n\nIt used to be a relatively small competition held once a year around the Christmas break, with one team from each continent and a host nation\u2019s club. But now, it\u2019s growing and that\u2019s a good thing.\n\nWhat I really enjoy is how this tournament gives clubs from outside Europe a chance to show their style and talent on a global stage. We\u2019ve seen some amazing games from teams in Asia, South America, North America, and Africa. They\u2019ve shown they can hold their own against European giants, and that proves that European football is often overrated or at least unfairly seen as untouchable.\n\nI\u2019ve been watching the Club World Cup from the start, and I\u2019ve genuinely been impressed by how competitive and entertaining the matches are. Every player and every club is fighting for the win, it means something.\n\nOf course, I know there are critics. Some say the tournament is just a money grab or that it adds to player fatigue. But let\u2019s be honest, domestic leagues and cups are also about money and chasing silverware. The Club World Cup is no different in that sense.\n\nIf we\u2019re talking about fixture congestion, I don\u2019t think the Club World Cup is the main problem. For example, in England, we have both the FA Cup and the League Cup, why not just stick to one? Also, getting rid of replay matches would help reduce the number of games during the season.\n\nHonestly, I even think the Europa Conference League is unnecessary. It just adds more games and dilutes the quality.\n\nThat said, the one thing I don\u2019t agree with in the new Club World Cup format is the number of European teams involved. I think it should be more balanced across all continents. It\u2019s a \u201cWorld\u201d Cup, after all, let\u2019s give more representation to the rest of the world.\n\nI know some people might hate on this opinion, and that\u2019s fine. But as a football fan who\u2019s followed this tournament from the start, I believe it has the potential to become something truly great.",

    "selftext": "Since the start of the Club World Cup, I\u2019ve noticed a big surge of interest in South American football and a bunch of redditors asking about the culture, history, and what really matters to fans down here. I grew up between European and Latin American families, so I figured I\u2019d try to explain a few key points that might help it all make more sense, especially for a European audience. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions\n\n**The Copa Libertadores and the Intercontinental/Club World Cup are massive.**\n\nIn South America, a club\u2019s legacy is built on winning the Copa Libertadores, and even more so on becoming Club World champions. That title carries enormous cultural weight. Interestingly, it is not really about bragging to Europeans, but it's more about earning a kind of \"permanent\" prestige across the continent.\n\nFor example, Velez Sarsfield of Argentina has only one Libertadores title (1994), but it is their Intercontinental Cup win that is represented by a star above their crest, showing which achievement they value most. The same goes for Santos FC of Brazil, who have won three Libertadores titles, yet only display two stars for their world titles from the 1960s. Despite going 34 years without another major title, Santos had already secured permanent cultural status as one of Brazil's most important clubs.  \n  \nSo here\u2019s a way to think about it: **two rough tiers**.\n\n**Tier 1: Clubs that won both the Club World and Libertadores titles**\n\nSo\u2026these clubs are seen as continentally iconic, regardless of how many times they\u2019ve won each title. They aren\u2019t just sports teams, they\u2019re important cultural institutions with massive fan bases and national influence.\n\n**Boca Juniors and River Plate (Argentina)** The closest thing to Real Madrid and Barcelona in South America. However, it\u2019s quite different in that Boca has always marketed itself as the grittier, working-class club, while River is known for \u201cbeautiful football\u201d and a more refined image. Both are continental giants, but it\u2019s their Libertadores and Intercontinental wins that cemented their status in the popular consciousness, not just in Argentina, but all over South America.\n\n**Olimpia (Paraguay)** A perfect example of a club from a smaller market (Paraguay\u2019s population is 6.8 million) being recognized like a giant. Olimpia has won three Libertadores titles across different eras, which gave them all-time status. Even if they face a huge Brazilian club like, say Vasco da Gama, Olimpia would still be seen by many as the \u201cbigger\u201d team, because of those historic titles, and of course notably the 1979 Intercontinental Cup win.  \n  \n**Nacional and Pe\u00f1arol (Uruguay)** Think Celtic and Rangers, but with the international prestige and title count of AC Milan and Inter Milan. Despite coming from a tiny country, both clubs are absolute footballing and cultural giants. Each has won three club world titles, which is very rare. Their legacy is untouchable in South American history, as both helped shape the lore of the Copa Libertadores during its crucial first three decades.\n\n**Estudiantes, Velez, and Racing (Argentina)** Even though Estudiantes has won more Libertadores (4), Velez and Racing are considered part of the elite in Argentina because of their Intercontinental Cup wins. It\u2019s telling that Estudiantes proudly promotes their 1968 Intercontinental title on their crest over Manchester United more than their four Libertadores trophies. Each of these clubs treated their Intercontinental Cup wins as their greatest achievement.\u00a0\n\n**Sao Paulo, Santos FC, Gremio, Flamengo, Internacional (Brazil)** This is Brazilian football\u2019s gold tier, especially due to their club world championships. Sao Paulo\u2019s relatively recent Intercontinental Cup wins of 1992 and 1993 cemented the club in the upper echelon of Brazil\u2019s football hierarchy. It just shows how important adding that essential club world title is to each club\u2019s legacy.\n\n\\--- **Tier 2: Big clubs missing the Club World title**  \nThe rest of the clubs here are still considered national and continental \"big teams\", but they're generally seen on a bit of a lower tier. One notable example is:\n\n**Palmeiras (Brazil)** One of the most famous moments in recent Brazilian fan banter came when Palmeiras lost the Club World Cup knockout match to Chelsea. Immediately, Corinthians fans took to the streets to celebrate that Palmeiras failed to reach the level of a (recognized) club world champion. Even though Palmeiras has more Libertadores (3\u20131), Corinthians fans feel they have bragging rights because of their 2 club world titles.",

However, he had a tendency to sign injury-prone players, and that decision backfired.

Eventually, Paul Simpson left the club.\n\nThe board then appointed an inexperienced manager, Mike Williamson, a former Premier League defender with Newcastle.

With that kind of spending, we should be doing far better.\n\nSurprisingly, football legend Mark Hughes has now confirmed that he\u2019s staying on as manager for the upcoming season.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about this?

But by then, it was too late, we were relegated to the National League.\n\nI recently saw a news article highlighting Carlisle United as the highest paying club across League One and League Two, with a wage bill of \u00a35 million, while most other clubs in those leagues operate between \u00a32\u20133 million. With that kind of spending, we should be doing far better.\n\nSurprisingly, football legend Mark Hughes has now confirmed that he\u2019s staying on as manager for the upcoming season.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about this? What do you think went wrong for Carlisle? Who is to blame?",

So much is placed on his supposed \"laziness\", yet completely ignoring the star power he possess attacking wise. People say that the only players that are allowed to completely not press are Ronaldo and Messi, but in my opinion, Mbappe isn't even that far off. He has finished with the European golden boot, has consistently hit 50 G/A per season for the last 6-7 years, and has consistently shown up in big games. He is objectively one of the best in the world. If Haaland or Salah stopped pressing completely this season, fans would undoubtedly still tout them as top players, and best in the world. Yet Mbappe is talked about as a universal negative.\n\nThere's also this narrative that PSG instantly became better without him and Real Madrid instantly became worse, meaning that Mbappe is a bad influence on a team. To say that is to completely discredit PSG's current season, by saying that the Champions League is the only trophy of significance that a French team could win. Ignoring the countless league titles and domestic trophies that Mbappe won with PSG would turn the current PSG's historic season into a run of the mill champions league winning team no different than any other Champions league winning team last year. If you want to recognize PSG's current greatness, then it is disinegenous to say that Mbappe \"failed\" at PSG. Keep in mind that Mbappe also reached a UCL final with PSG, only to be beaten by one goal to a very strong Bayern team. \n\nIt's also weird to place Real Madrid's failures on Mbappe as well, placing him as the face of the team's failures, when the issues that the Real Madrid team faced in the past season have been chronic issues that have plagued the team for a while now. Lack of running and pressing in the team, lack of attacking identity, focusing on star-power and names instead of tactical cohesion. It is valid to say that Mbappe might contribute to these problems, but the amount of blame that football fans are putting on the team's top goal scorer and best player is insane in my opinion.",

    "title": "Do caps versus non-FIFA members that are members of a continental association count as full caps?",
    "selftext": "With the GOLD Cup recently finished, I was wondering...\n\nNormally caps per played international game are important. Once you are over 20 years old and played a competitive game (= qualifiers or games at a major tournament) you can no longer change national team even if you have dual citizens. You are in other words tied to that one national team for the rest of your career.\n\nHowever, in the CONCACAF, in addition to full FIFA members like USA/Mexico/Canada/Costa Rica/etc there are some national teams not affiliated to FIFA but affiliated to CONCACAF. Those national teams thus participate in the GOLD Cup or at least in its qualifiers. Examples include Guadeloupe, Martinique, and I think also Bonaire and St-Martin?\n\nSo imagine you are American and called up for the USA national team. If USA would play against Guadeloupe or Martinique at the GOLD Cup, would that game result in a cap fully recognised by FIFA? I am unsure because one team (USA) is a full FIFA member, the other (Guadeloupe or Martinique) is a full CONCACAF member but not a FIFA member. So do such games result in a FIFA-recognised cap?\n\n  \nNormally a friendly against a non-FIFA member like Greenland or Northern Cyprus won't result in an official cap. However, in case of for example USA vs Guadeloupe, this is an actual game in an official continental tournament organised by CONCACAF. So would the USA players that play that game earn a cap or not?\n\nGOLD Cup is just one example. In Oceania there are other examples. Tuvalu is not a FIFA-member but it is a member or associate member of the Oceanian Football Confederation. One time they allowed Tuvalu to participate in the World Cup qualifiers (which is an official FIFA-sanctioned competition) as those same qualifiers also counted to determine participation in the Oceanian continental championship. Hence, Tuvalu was a non-FIFA member participating in World Cup qualifiers against full FIFA-members such as Solomon Islands, Samoa, etc. Would those players who played in the game against Tuvalu earn a cap that is fully recognised by FIFA?",

    "text": "Starting to hate Luis Enrique\n\nHe has been cocky and arrogant throughout the season. Always shut down journalists and gave overconfident replies to the few he answered. All this is fine when you win and work hard. PSG have been winning and have actually been playing the best football so everything is forgiven. Not today though. They were skinned by Chelsea and suddenly Enrique brings on his full mafia mode and slaps the shit out of an opposition player. What a disgraceful person to have as your coach. No wonder PSG play dirty and can\u2019t take losing. They were super dirty against Bayern as well. A team is always a reflection of the coach and Enrique has shown himself to be an arrogant and utterly disgraceful person.",

    "selftext": "I was looking up the amount Atletico have spent on transfers since 2014 and it's slightly over \u20ac1 billion. They outspent Real Madrid in the last 10 years. (PS:- I know Real have signed a lot of free players too.) But even after spending that much, you'd expect them to achieve slightly more. They've had some incredible talents over the years too (Griezmann, Koke, Saul, Godin, Courtois, Torres, Alvarez, Oblak...)\nThe competition with Real and Bar\u00e7a has definitely not made it easy. In my opinin the 'building phase' which i would consider to be from 2014-2021 was really successful. They achieved 2 League Titles, 2 UEL, 2 domeatic cups and 2 UCL finals. They were in that period very dominant. But in the last 4 years, where you'd expect them to start competing with Real Madrid and Barcelona, they've seemed to drop standard although they've made some great signings in Alvarez, De Paul, Cunha, LeNormand, Gallagher and S\u00f8rloth. Simeone has some of the best attacking players in europe but he seems to be stuck with his defensive ways which would be fine if they were winning but they aren't. I think Atletico needs to move on with a better Project with this new generation. Simeone also looks like he needs a break. A team of this quality can't go 4 years without trophies. They need new ideas at the club. What do you guys think?",

Notre sueur, nos chants, notre Mosson.\n\nJ\u2019ai vu les tribunes se vider parfois, mais jamais notre c\u0153ur.  \nJ\u2019ai vu des maintiens arrach\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019orgueil, des humiliations encaiss\u00e9es sans baisser les bras.  \nDes soirs sans enjeu. Des soirs magiques. Des soirs o\u00f9 on chantait juste pour ne pas s\u2019\u00e9teindre.\n\nEt aujourd\u2019hui, alors qu\u2019on va descendre\u2026 l\u2019ann\u00e9e de nos 50 ans\u2026  \nj\u2019ai la gorge nou\u00e9e.\n\nPas parce qu\u2019on tombe. Mais parce que **\u00e7a finit comme \u00e7a**.  \nSans \u00e9clat, sans col\u00e8re, presque dans l\u2019indiff\u00e9rence.  \nComme une larme sous la pluie.\n\nMais on sera l\u00e0. Moi, je serai l\u00e0. M\u00eame \u00e0 10 000km, je serai l\u00e0.\n\nEn Ligue 2, contre Concarneau ou Bastia.  \nAvec un short trop grand, un drapeau rinc\u00e9 par les ann\u00e9es, et la certitude qu\u2019on finira par remonter.  \nParce que la Paillade, c\u2019est pas un classement. C\u2019est pas une ligue. C'est certainement pas les mercenaires qui la compose...  \nC\u2019est un feu qui ne s\u2019\u00e9teint jamais.\n\n\u266a\u266b Je t'aime plus que la coca\u00efne...\u266b\u266a",

Sources indicate that the league could have created the streaming RSN last summer while finalizing its $77B national media rights deal, but considered local TV a prohibitive revenue source -- and preferred to wait and negotiate a higher-end deal with entities such as Amazon, YouTube, Apple, Roku, ESPN or Peacock.\n\n> But while the league has taken a measured approach, individual teams have had to lock in their own local TV deals in the short term, which is why all signs point to a 2027-28 national RSN launch date. \n\nAccording to this article, these teams would not be under contract with a local RSN at the end of the 26-27 season, and would thus be eligible to jump on a national NBA streaming service:\n\n- Bucks\n- Bulls\n- Cavaliers\n- Clippers\n- Grizzlies\n- Hawks\n- Heat\n- Hornets\n- Jazz\n- Magic\n- Mavericks\n- Nets\n- Nuggets\n- Pacers\n- Pelicans\n- Spurs\n- Suns\n- Thunder\n- Timberwolves\n- Trailblazers\n\nThis doesn't guarantee that all those teams would jump on.

The Rockets are co-owners of their Space City network and could likewise have maneuverability. The NBC Sports RSNs are owned by Comcast, which has a piece of the Sixers and is now a league media partner. That, too, could create an avenue for their teams (Sixers, Warriors, Kings, Celtics) to eventually opt in. In other words, the league\u2019s national RSN will likely grow in increments.\n\nAs anyone who follows Dolan and his beef with the NBA knows, I'd expect the Knicks to be the very last time to join the national streaming service, and they might never join it, at least until Dolan croaks or sells the team.\n\nEDIT: A funny part in this article, apparently the teams that have gone OTA have been disappointed in the level of reach they are getting.

And well ahead of schedule when you look at the history of NBA players who have had this type of problem. We can now say that this thrombosis is officially behind me. Normally, it won't happen again. Now I have to continue with specific work on my shoulder, and above all get back to my basketball habits. I haven't played 5-on-5 for five months now.

But, yes, of course. I know it's not everyone's ambition in the NBA, but it's obviously my dream to spend my entire career with one franchise.\n\n**MA: In recent weeks, several NBA stars have been linked with San Antonio, such as Kevin Durant, who eventually left for Houston, or Giannis Antetokounmpo, still with Milwaukee.

Beringer is stronger, more athletic, a better rim protector and has only been playing basketball for like 4 years.. Hansen is just so smart, great screener, does all the little things right.

They both grunted with pleasure, and before long Game 7 turned into an all out orgy fest.\n\nEven though the refs tried to desperately stop them, they too became entranced by whatever spell took over the stadium and soon the whole arena was filled with naked dudes banging each other.  The national guard had to be called in, and it took 48 hours until the whole thing finally came to an end.\n\nThe ultimate question heard around the world that day was \u201cHow does this affect LeBron\u2019s legacy?\u201d",
