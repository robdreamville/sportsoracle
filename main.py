# SportsOracle: Main Pipeline Entrypoint
# =========================
# This script runs the full SportsOracle data pipeline:
#   1. Scrapes Reddit and ESPN for sports news/posts
#   2. Embeds and clusters the data for downstream analysis
#   3. (Planned) Summarizes trends, builds FAISS index, and serves a dashboard
#
# To run the full pipeline, simply execute this file.
# =========================

# =========================
# TODOs & Next Steps
# =========================
# 1. Add stopword filtering to cluster analysis (remove words like "of", "the", "in")
# 2. Automate full pipeline in main.py and test end-to-end
# 3. Add error handling and logging to scrapers and embedding steps
# 4. Build simple keyword/summary extractor per cluster
# 5. Plan integration of semantic search (FAISS or similar)
# 6. Choose lightweight dashboard framework (Streamlit recommended)
# 7. Build UI to display outputs/trends_summary.json with sport filters
# 8. Integrate FAISS semantic search for querying trends/posts
# 9. Add UI controls: search bar, time filters, refresh data button
# 10. Offload heavy GPU tasks (embedding, summarization) to offline/scheduled jobs
# 11. Deploy locally or in cloud container/VM for easy access
# 12. Add simple visualizations (keyword frequency, cluster sizes) for clarity
